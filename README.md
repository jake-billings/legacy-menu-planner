# legacy-menu-planner #
This repository is part of a series of repositories documenting the code I wrote when I was first learning computer programming. Please do not use this repository to evaluate my professional software development skills. I keep these legacy repositories on Github for myself in order to look back on this code with nostalgia.

This code was last updated *January 8th, 2010*.
This code was committed to GitHub *October 2nd, 2017*.

Menu Planner was an application I developed for my family to keep track of the different dishes we could have for dinner. It was never used, but I learned a lot about Java and Swing GUI programming.
